## Overview

Commands are reusable prompt snippets that help you quickly invoke preset prompts.

## Slash Commands

Type `/` in the input box to trigger slash commands:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/copy` | Copy the last AI response |
| `/log` | Open the log window |
| `/browse` | Browse message history |
| `/config` | Open the configuration panel |
| `/model` | Switch model |
| `/archive` | Archive current conversation |
| `/clear` | New conversation |
| `/theme` | Switch theme |
| `/resume` | Resume historical session |
| `/dump` | Export raw session messages |
| `/dump-processed` | Export processed session data |
| `/teammate` | Teammate panel |

## Custom Commands

### Usage

Reference a command with `@command:<name>` in the input box:

```
@command:review Please review this code
```

### Creating Commands

#### Directory Locations

| Level | macOS / Linux | Windows |
|-------|---------------|---------|
| User-level | `~/.jdata/agent/commands/` | `%USERPROFILE%\.jdata\agent\commands\` |
| Project-level | `.jcli/commands/` | `.jcli\commands\` |

Project-level commands have higher priority.

#### File Format

Each command is a Markdown file with YAML frontmatter and prompt body:

```markdown
---
name: review
description: Code review prompt
---
Please perform a comprehensive review of the following code, focusing on:
- Code quality
- Potential issues
- Improvement suggestions
```

#### Two Organization Methods

**Method 1: Single File**

Create `.md` files directly in the commands directory:

```
commands/
  review.md
  test.md
```

**Method 2: Directory Structure**

Create a directory with a `COMMAND.md` inside (suitable for complex commands with resource files):

```
commands/
  review/
    COMMAND.md
    checklist.txt
```

### Example

Create a `plan.md`:

```markdown
---
name: plan
description: Enter PLAN mode
---
Please enter plan mode to plan the task
```

Usage:

```
@command:plan
```

### Managing Commands

Press `Ctrl+E` in the TUI to open the configuration panel, switch to the Commands tab to enable or disable commands.
